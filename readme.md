# HMD Glass: Head-Mounted Autonomous Battle Bot

## Description
HMD Glass is a wearable head-mounted robot designed for mini wrestling-style autonomous combat. It visually detects opponents, reacts with smart movement, and alerts when flipped, all inside a compact 3D-printed glasses frame.

## Why I Built It
Inspired by the fusion of robotics and wearables, I created this device to see the autonomous behavior in a constrained space. It's a testbed for visual recognition, feedback loops, and fall-alert systems, all packed into an HMD form factor thatâ€™s lightweight and functional.
